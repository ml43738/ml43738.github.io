<h3 class="city" style="color:green"><strong>Who is Taylor Swift?</strong></h3>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift">Taylor Swift Wikipedia</a>

<p style="font-size:120%;">She was born in December 13, 1989 in Pennsylvania. <i>When she was 14, she began to pursue her country music career.</i>
She became the youngest artist which recorded by the Sony/ATV Music publishing house. So far, she has released six albums:<b>Taylor Swift,Fearless,Speak Now,Red,1989,Reputation.</b>
In her singer career, she won many awards and achievements: Grammy Awards, American Music Awards, Billboard Music Awards, etc.</p>
<h3 class="city" style="color:green;">Who to evaluate Taylor Swift?</h3>
<p style="font-size:120%;">I think she is <strong>great live</strong>. Her acoustic sets are absolutely stunning and her voice is so pure.
I think she's awesome because she has a kind of innocence to her that is very appealing.
Her songs are progressive. Although she changed her song style from country to popular, she still is the top-level in country music.
In fact, I think all successful people must have something extraordinary. Like Tayloy, there is a clear musical ideal of ten years old, and perseverance of pepeople.
Is her succcess fell from the sky?
<em>No, just many people who are picky have jealousy for Taylor's success.</em>
</p>
<h3 class="city" style="color:green;">Why <<1989>> is the most appealing album in Tyolor's whole albums?</h3>
<p style="font-size:120%;">Emotional expression is unchanged. For example, Style song, in Moldy's own words is "there will always be a boy in your lifeã€‚ Although you may not be with him eventually, there is always such a moment you think that you are so ride Tune, you think he will rushed to your wedding scene to take you away "(the effect), I think this song on the expression of this emotion is too accurate, and I often listen to this capital kind I was the idol heroine Short fantasy (boys may think this fantasy is ridiculous, but I dare say that almost every girl has had this time.</p>
